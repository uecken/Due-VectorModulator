# Due-VectorModulator
Use HMC630LP3E and Arduino Due

# Function
- set gain,phase by "-20,90" via serial.
- Calibration, like  "cal,Q,1.35,1.36,0.01,1.49" via serial. 
  Need to find minimum gain by searching I/Q. The I/Q is Vmi/Vmq.

#Accuracy
- Phase Error: 2-3 degree OK
- Aplitude Error: 5-10dB  NG
